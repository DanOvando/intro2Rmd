# Hands-on

## Explain the environment

## References

You need:

- A BibTeX file (provided in the CourseMaterials folder)
- Specify `bibliography:` and `csl:` in the header
- That's it...

"A tidy dataset has one column per variable" [@wickham_2014]

**References**

<div id="refs"></div>

### Other resources for references

- [Citation style library](http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/)

- Tyler Clavelle has a great [tutorial](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/reference_tips/) on this

## Code chunks and in-line code

- There were `r nrow(mtcars)` cars studied

- Used to isolate plain text from code
- Allow you to execute R, Python, Rcpp, SQL, and Stan within your file
- Use `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I` (Windows) `Cmd` + `Alt` + `I` (Mac) to insert
- Always name your chunks!

## Load packages

## Code chunk options

- CHUNK NAMES!
- `echo` hides code from output
- `eval` evaluate chunk?
- `fig.width`
- `fig.height`
- `fig.cap` To add figure caption

## `echo = TRUE`

Fit a linear model (mpg ~ disp) and inspect with summary

## `echo = FALSE`

Same as above

## Fancier way to report models with `stargazer`

results = 'asis'


## Fancier way to report models with `stargazer`

Modify stargazer with title, singe.row, covariate.labels, omit.stat

- Awesome [examples by Jake Russ](http://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/)

## Figures with code

Plot disp vs mpg

## Tables

Create raw markdown table


## Tables with `knitr` and `kable`

Table from Data/taxa_table.csv and knitr

Using the `taxa_table.csv` file in the `CourseMaterials`

## California's State Fish

![Juvenile Garibaldi (*Hypsypops rubicundus*)](http://www.fishbase.org/images/species/Hyrub_j0.jpg)

- October 15, 1995, Adopted as the California State Marine Fish

## Fancier tables with `kableExtra`

But scientific names (*Genus species*) are supposed to be in italics!

- Specify format by columns

## Fancier tables with `kableExtra`

- Collapse rows for clarity

## If there is time

Do one of the following assignments. Should be less than 5 minutes

- Create an html document:
    - Title
    - Subtitle
    - Author
    - Include at least 1 reference from the BibTex file
    - A list with bullets
    - Bold and itallics
    - 1 plot (nothing meaningful, invent something or use existing data)
    - 1 `knitr` + `kableExtra` table
    - Code doesn't show

- Create a presentation:
    - Title slide
    - Slide with picture (no code)
    - Slide with some R code and output
